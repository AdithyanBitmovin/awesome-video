Adding Alternate Media to a Playlist | Apple Developer Documentation - Back to Basics: Encoding Definition and Adaptive Bitrate - Create your own video streaming server with Linux - Live video streaming is incredibly popular\u2014and it's still growing. Platforms like Amazon's Twitch and Google's YouTube boast millions of users that stream and consume countless hours of live and recorded media. These services are often free to use but require you to have an account and generally hold your content behind advertisements. Some people don't need their videos to be available to the masses or just want more control over their content. Thankfully, with the power of open source software, anyone can set up a live streaming server.

You'll deliver noticeably higher quality video if you follow the advice detailed below. Encoding-for-HEVC - Eyevinn/docker-hevc - Docker container to create HEVC streaming packages - Eyevinn/docker-hevc Guide to HEVC/H.265 Encoding and Playback - HEVC's main advantage over H.264 is that it offers roughly double the compression ratio for the same quality. This means that a video file encoded with HEVC can occupy half the space of its H.264 equivalent with no noticeable change in quality, or the same amount of space with improved quality. HEVC in HLS: 10 Key Questions for Streaming Video Developers - Many who heard that Apple is adding support for HEVC playback in HTTP Live Streaming were left with more questions than answers.

Encoding-for-HEVC - Eyevinn/docker-hevc - Docker container to create HEVC streaming packages - Eyevinn/docker-hevc Guide to HEVC/H.265 Encoding and Playback - HEVC's main advantage over H.264 is that it offers roughly double the compression ratio for the same quality.
